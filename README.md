# Laser-Reflector
A game for Gamedev.js Jam 2021

The jam is about anything that can run on the Web in a browser. The theme is "mirror". And the first idea that came to my mind was reflecting rays through mirror. 

My entry is like a prototype more than a game but I got inspired a lot.

I continue developing it.
